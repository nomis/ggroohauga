Logitech® Z906 Surround Sound Speakers
======================================

Overview
--------

Alternative console and simulated amplifier interface for the ESP32-S3
microcontroller interacting with Logitech® Z906 Surround Sound Speakers.

    Glod picked up his horn. Cliff sat down and found his hammers. Buddy walked
    to the centre of the stage and, to Cliff's amazement, just stood there
    looking down at his feet.

    The cheering began to subside. And then it died away altogether. The huge
    hall was filled with the hush of hundreds of people holding their breath.

    Buddy's fingers moved. He picked out three simple little chords. And then he
    looked up.

    "Hello, Ankh-Morpork!"

    Cliff felt the music rise up behind him and rush him forward into a tunnel
    of fire and sparks and excitement. He brought his hammers down. And it was
    Music With Rocks In.
